Unicorns don't exist

Violet
Purple
Pink
Orange
Blue
Green
Indigo
Yellow
Crimson

These are the colours of the rainbow.
Rainbows spreads happiness just like its colors
And the beautiful pony eats some baloney
And the unicorn eats grass
Pony
sun is yellow 
I like turtles
Banana
Garfief
I want some lasaga jon
And the unicorn.
Pony
Banana
Im on fire
Chicken on hot
The Pony running on the ground.
And the beautiful pony.
And the unicorn eats grass.
The sun is yellow. 
I like turtles.

This is an amazing poem on rainbows





Roses are red 
Violets are blue
my computer is fast
but yours is slow
