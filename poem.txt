Im on fire
Chicken on hot
The Pony running on the ground.
And the beautiful pony.
And the unicorn eats grass.
The sun is yellow. 
I like turtles.

Monkeys, oh Monkeys!!
Those little mischievous creatures
They love bananas
They stole my shoes once...

Roses are red 
Violets are blue
my computer is fast
but yours is slow

When the days are cold
All you need to do is 
turn on the heater!
